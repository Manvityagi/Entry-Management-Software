**Entry Management Software** is an implementation of a multi-host, multi-visitor entry management system.
## üî®  Working
  - The system is flexible to accomodate multiple hosts for multiple visitors. 
  - The software admin can register new hosts by using the ```Register as host``` option from Home Page.
  - ```Check-in as guest``` checks in the visitor & allots a host to the visitor from the the host attending the least visitors at that time. At the same time , an email and sms is sent to the host alloted for the visitor about the details of the visitor
  - ```Check-out Guest``` checks out the visitor & sends an email & sms to the visitor including relevant details
  
## üöß  Technology Stack
- **Server Enviornment** - NodeJS
- **Framework** - ExpressJS
- **Database** - MongoDB
- **Cloud database service** - MongoDB Atlas
- **Module to send emails** - NodeMailer
- **SMS sending** - Twilio
- **Deployment** - Heroku

**Note** : SMS can be sent to only Twilio verified numbers as I am not using the paid service.

# üí° Approach
### Alloting Hosts to Visitors
 - One of the main bottlenecks was to decide the approach to allot visitors to the hosts.
 - For the same, I came up with the idea to store the count of visitors, each host is attending at any time.
 - Whenever a new visitor checks-in, I sort the hosts based on the count of visitors they are attending currently, and allot the host with miniumum visitor to the new visitor.
 - When any visitor checks out, the visitor-count for the host of that visitor is decreased by one.
 - The above approach ensures optimized distrubution of visitors among hosts.
 ### Mailing 
- Mails are sent by an admin email-id to the host when a visitor checks in & to the visitor when she/he checks-out using the nodemailer module
### SMS
- SMS are sent to to the host when a visitor checks in & to the visitor when she/he checks-out using Twilio's free account
### Validations and Error Handling
- Email and Phone numbers are validate for correct format, and errors due to duplicacy of index data are reported using connect-flash
